# AM_Gyms (BAM-QMDP Repository)

This folder contains the following RL-environments (in openAI Gym format):

- Frozen_lake.py      : a copy of the standard openAI Gym environment with the same name;
- Frozen_lake_v2.py   : a 'less random' version of OpenAI's frozen lake environment;
- Loss_Env.py         : a custom environment designed to test Measurement Regret;
- NChainEnv.py        : an implementation of the (discontinued) OpenAI chain environment;
- Blackjack.py        : a version of OpenAI's Blackjack environment, which returns non-factorised states;
- Sepsis folder       : an RL-environment introduced by Nam et al (2021) for Active Measure reinforced learning.

Furthermore, it contains the following additional files:
- AM_Env_wrapper        : a wrapper class to add measuring functionality to openAI gyms.
- ModelLearner.py       : a class to learn the dynamics of an environment (i.e. transition function, rewards, done-states & Q-values) using method described by Delage and Mannor (2010).

For the first three environments mentioned above, data can be found in the data folder. The others were only used for testing, so no data has been saved.
