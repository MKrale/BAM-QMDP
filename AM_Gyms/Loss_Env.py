    Measure Loss environment
    This simple environment describes an MDP with 3 states: one initial state s0,
    one 'positive' state s+ and one 'negative' state s-.
    From every state, taking action 1 (backward) returns to the initial state.
    From s0, taking action 0 has a chance p to change the state to s+,
    and a chance (1-p) to change to s-
    From s+, taking action 0 ends the run and gives reward r.
    From s-, taking action 0 also end the run but gives no reward.
    This environment is described in the report Merlijn Krale (link here!), 
    and is used to test Active-Measuring algorithms.
